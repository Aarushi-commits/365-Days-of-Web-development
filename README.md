📌 What This Repository Is

This repository defines a clear, structured roadmap for anyone who wants to learn web development properly — not randomly.

Instead of tutorials scattered across the internet, this repo provides:

Day-wise, project-based learning

Real-world concepts in the right order

A roadmap you can follow, reference, or contribute to

It is designed to be used, not just starred.

🧭 Two Parallel Learning Tracks
🎬 Animation Web Development

Focuses on how the web feels:

UI motion & micro-interactions

Scroll-based storytelling

SVG, Canvas, WebGL

Performance-aware animations

🏗️ Product Web Development

Focuses on how the web works:

Frontend applications

Backend APIs

Authentication & data flow

Full-stack systems & deployment

Both tracks progress in parallel inside the same repository.

🎯 Why This Exists

Most people fail at web development because they:

Learn tools before fundamentals

Skip important concepts

Build without understanding progression

This repository exists to fix that.
