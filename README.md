✨ What is this repository?

This repository is a public, open-source roadmap for anyone who wants to learn web development in a structured and practical way.

Instead of:

❌ random tutorials

❌ disconnected projects

❌ framework hopping

This roadmap focuses on:

✅ clear progression

✅ learning by building

✅ real-world skills

✅ long-term consistency

You can follow it, fork it, or contribute to improving it.

🧭 Why “365 × 2”?

Because modern web developers need two equally important skill sets.

🎬 Animation Web Development

How the web feels

✨ UI motion & micro-interactions

🌀 Scroll-based storytelling

🎨 SVG, Canvas & WebGL

⚡ Performance-aware animations

🏗️ Product Web Development

How the web works

🧩 Frontend applications

🔌 Backend APIs

🔐 Authentication & data flow

🚀 Full-stack systems & deployment

👉 Both tracks run in parallel, inside one repository.
