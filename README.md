🌐 365 × 2 Web Development Roadmap
An Open-Source, Community-Built Learning Path



📖 About This Project

The 365 × 2 Web Development Roadmap is an open-source initiative aimed at creating a clear, structured, and practical learning path for anyone who wants to become a modern web developer.

Instead of random tutorials or isolated projects, this repository provides:

-A day-wise progression

-Real projects, not toy examples

-Coverage of both creative and engineering aspects of web development

-A roadmap that evolves through community contribution and review

This repository is not just for contributors — it is meant to be used as a public reference roadmap by students, self-learners, and institutions.

🎯 Purpose & Vision :-

Modern web development requires more than just knowing a framework.

This roadmap is built around the belief that a strong web developer must understand:
How interfaces feel → Motion, animation, interaction

How systems work → Architecture, data, users, scalability

Our Goal

To create a single, open, structured roadmap that:

Takes a learner from zero to production-ready

Emphasizes learning by building

Is maintainable, reviewable, and extensible

Remains framework-agnostic, focusing on fundamentals first

🧭 Why Two Parallel Tracks?

The roadmap is divided into two complementary tracks, maintained inside the same repository.

🎬 Animation Web Development Track

Focuses on:

Motion principles

Micro-interactions

Scroll-based storytelling

Canvas, SVG, and WebGL

Performance-aware animations

This track helps learners understand how users emotionally experience the web.

🏗️ Product Web Development Track

Focuses on:

Real-world frontend applications

Backend systems & APIs

Authentication & authorization

Full-stack architecture

Deployment and scalability

This track helps learners understand how real products are built and maintained.

🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized exactly like a learning curriculum, with clearly named projects and day ranges.

Each day folder represents a single learning objective or project, and includes:

Source code

Assets (if required)

A short README.md explaining what was built and why

📅 Roadmap Philosophy

This roadmap spans 365 days per track, but it is self-paced.

Learners can:

Follow it day-by-day

Use it as a reference curriculum

Pick phases relevant to their goals

Learning Progression

Foundations → Systems → Advanced Concepts → Capstone Projects

Concepts are revisited with increasing complexity

Emphasis on clarity, maintainability, and reasoning

🧠 Who Is This For?

This roadmap is suitable for:

Beginners starting from scratch

Students looking for a structured path

Self-taught developers filling gaps

Contributors who want real open-source experience

Mentors and organizations designing curricula

🤝 How the Community Helps

This roadmap improves through open-source collaboration.

Contributors can:

Add new projects

Improve documentation

Optimize existing solutions

Review and refine roadmap structure

Suggest better sequencing of concepts

All contributions are reviewed to ensure:

Conceptual correctness

Progressive difficulty

Educational clarity

📌 Contribution Expectations

To maintain roadmap quality:

Each contribution must align with the learning objective

Code must be readable and documented

PRs must explain what is being added and why

Low-effort or duplicate content is discouraged

Detailed rules are available in CONTRIBUTING.md.

🌱 Long-Term Vision

Our aim is to make this repository:

A reference roadmap for web development

A community-validated curriculum

A bridge between tutorial learning and real engineering

A living document that evolves with the web

🧠 Core Principle

Learn by building.
Build with intention.
Understand before optimizing.

📬 Getting Started :-

Explore the ROADMAP.md

Choose a track or phase

Start building

Use the repository as a guide, not a race .

How interfaces feel → Motion, animation, interaction

How systems work → Architecture, data, users, scalability
