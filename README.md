🌐 365 × 2 Web Development Roadmap

Animation Engineering × Product Engineering

An open-source repository that defines a structured learning roadmap for modern web development.
This project is meant to be used as a reference curriculum, not just a code dump.

📌 What This Repository Is

This repository provides:

A clear, project-based roadmap for learning web development

Day-wise, phase-wise progression

Real projects instead of isolated tutorials

Coverage of both UI motion and product engineering

Anyone can follow this roadmap independently, at their own pace.

🧭 Why Two Tracks?

Modern web developers need to understand both experience and engineering.

🎬 Animation Track

Covers:

UI motion and micro-interactions

Scroll-based effects

SVG, Canvas, and WebGL

Performance-aware animations

🏗️ Product Track

Covers:

Frontend applications

Backend APIs

Authentication and data flow

Full-stack systems and deployment

Both tracks live in the same repository and progress in parallel.
